Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

This project demonstrates text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion and Hugging Face's Diffusers library, implemented in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook leverages PyTorch for GPU-accelerated inference, making it accessible for users with free Colab resources.

Project Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook (Image_generation_using_LLM_with_hugging_face.ipynb) that showcases how to generate high-quality images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion. The notebook is designed to run seamlessly in Colab with GPU support.

Features





Text-to-image generation with Stable Diffusion.



GPU acceleration via PyTorch in Google Colab.



Clear documentation and example prompts.



Sample output images included.

Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:





Open the notebook in Google Colab:





Enable GPU acceleration:





Go to Runtime > Change runtime type.



Select GPU (e.g., T4 GPU) and save.



Run all cells sequentially to install dependencies and generate images.



Modify the text prompt in the notebook to create custom images (e.g., "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, digital art style").

Note: Dependencies are installed automatically via !pip install commands in the notebook.
